    <p>Roasted chicken never fails to impress, but it's surprisingly simple to make! 
        This juicy roasted chicken recipe is perfect for beginner cooks and old pros alike.</p>
        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken: This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black pepper, and onion powder.</li>
            <li>Butter: Butter (or margarine, if you prefer) locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to adhere to.</li>
            <li>Celery: Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cook.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan; season generously inside and out with onion powder, salt, and pepper. 
                Place 3 tablespoons of butter in chicken cavity; arrange dollops of remaining butter on the outside of chicken. 
                Cut celery into 3 or 4 pieces; place in the chicken cavity.</li>
                <li>Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. 
                    An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Remove from the oven and baste with drippings. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest for about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
                  
        </ol>
