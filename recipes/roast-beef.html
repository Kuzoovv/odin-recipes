    <p>Learn how to cook roast beef with this easy, weight-based formula guide for perfect rare roast beef every time. 
        This is your basic everyday eye round roast cooked to rare or medium-rare. Serve it to family or company. </p>
        <p><h2>Ingridients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds beef eye of round roast, at room temperature</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder, or more to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h2>Directions</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Make sure roast is at room temperature. Tie roast at 3-inch intervals with cotton twine; this helps it from drying out and allows it to cook more evenly. Place roast on a rack in a baking pan</li>
            <li>Mix together salt, garlic powder, and pepper in a small bowl. Rub seasoning mixture into the meat</li>
            <li>Place in the preheated oven and roast for 60 minutes, or 20 minutes per pound if your roast is larger or smaller. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 120 to 125 degrees F (49 to 52 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Cover loosely with foil, and let rest so juices can redistribute, 15 to 20 minutes</li>
            <li>Slice and serve</li>
